### Business Statement
Microsoft aims to establish a successful movie studio venture by leveraging insights from the current trends in the film industry. The company seeks to enter the entertainment sector by creating original video content, but lacks expertise in the domain of movie production. To ensure the studio's success, Microsoft intends to analyze the prevailing landscape of successful films at the box office and translate these findings into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.




### Business Problem

The main challenge facing Microsoft's new movie studio is the lack of domain knowledge and understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of films in the contemporary market. Without insights into the types of films that resonate with audiences and perform well at the box office, Microsoft risks investing resources in projects that may not yield desirable outcomes. Therefore, the primary business problem is to identify the key attributes and characteristics of successful films and use this information to guide the studio's content creation strategy, ensuring the production of commercially viable and audience-engaging movies.





### Business Recommendation

My recommendations to the new movie studio are:
*Genres of the movies should be selected from the most common genres and genres that get the most average votes
*The length of the movies should be more than average 86 minutes
*The movies made should target the domestic market although higher income comes from foreign
*Genres with a low number of average votes should be avoided since this may indicate a small audience
